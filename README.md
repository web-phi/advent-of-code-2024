# Advent of Code 2024

Each day has its own directory which contains a `solution.cpp` as well as an `input` file.

To compile and execute the program from day $X$ using Make, run `make run DIR=dayX` (e.g. `make run DIR=day16` for day $16$).

This will produce a `solution.exe` file in the specified directory.

To list all completed solutions, run `make list`.

To remove all `solution.exe` files from all the directories, run `make clean`.
